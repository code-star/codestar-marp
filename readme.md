- Run:

    ```bash
    mkdir decks/presentation-name
    cp example.md decks/presentation-name/slides.md
    ```
- Extra resource files (for example images) can go in that new folder as well
- Edit the new file in VS Code, and in the top right corner of the editor, click the preview button (or <kbd>âŒ˜ + K, V</kbd>)
    - Alternatively, you can run `marp -s --theme theme/codestar.css .` for a live server with a directory listing that you can navigate in a browser (you'll need [`marp-cli`](#development))
- Make a pull request and merge, GitHub actions will build the slides and serve them on GitHub pages (TODO: link)

## Development

Requirements:

- `brew install fswatch`
- `npm install -g sass`
- `npm install -g @marp-team/marp-cli`

Then, run `./watch.sh` to watch for changes in any SCSS file and rebuild the main CSS file.

*Note: the output `theme/codestar.css` is included in version control so that it can be hosted and used directly as a link to GitHub, it is generated code and not meant for editing.*
